# FTSO V2 Overview

![Overview](Overview.png)

A data provider system for FTSOv2 consists of the following components:

1. **Flare System Client**. Responsible for all interactions with the FTSOv2 smart contracts, including data collection and submission, voter registration, and additional system tasks.
2. **Data Provider**. Provides commit, reveal, and median result data to System Client for submission.
3. **Feed Value Provider**. Provides current values (prices) for a given set of feeds.
4. **Indexer**. Monitors the blockchain and records all FTSOv2 related transactions and events.

Reference implementations are provided for **Indexer**, **Flare System Client**, **Data Provider**, and providers are expected to plug in their own **Feed Value Provider** implementing a specific REST API (there is an sample implementation for testing).

## Operation

The following is a very simplified description of a single voting round operation.

**System Client** runs a scheduler which triggers voting actions every round (90s):
- On voting round start, obtain reveal data for the previous round from **Data Provider** and send to `Submission` smart contract.
- Once the reveal deadline passes (45s), obtain median result Merkle root from **Data Provider**, sign, and send to `Submission` smart contract. 
- Before the end of the voting round, obtain a feed value commit hash for the current round from the **Data Provider** (which will get processed in the following round).
- There is finalizer process which monitors the indexer database for signature transactions, and once enough signature weight for a voting round is gathered, submits the set of signatures to the `Relay` smart contract. If signature verification passes, the voting round is considered finalized. The `Relay` contract is the authoritative storage of confirmed voting round result Merkle roots.

Additionally, once in a reward epoch the **System Client** triggers voter registration, which allows participating in the following reward epoch.

**Data Provider** obtains all commit and reveal data straight from encoded transaction calldata recorded in the indexer database. All calls to `Submission` contract are simply empty function invocations, with the actual submission data provided as additional calldata on the transaction.

# Deployment

## Register accounts

Note: Account registration is required for FTSOv2 participation and must be done before starting any further deployment steps.

Each data provider in the FTSOv2 system must set up and register the following 5 accounts:

- `Identity`. Main identity account of the voter. On mainnets this should be held in cold storage, it's required for initial data provider setup but not used during each round on voting.
- `Submit`. Used for sending commit and reveal transactions.
- `SubmitSignatures`. Used for sending voting round result signature transactions. (To avoid nonce conflicts, **System Client** uses multiple accounts for submitting transactions).
- `SigningPolicy`. Used for signature generation during the voting round, and reward epoch signing policy signing (it's a system protocol ran once during reward epoch to establish reward epoch settings, including valid voters and their weights).
- `Delegation`. Account to which community should delegate funds (using WNat contract) to increase the vote power of the voter (identity/entity) - and also to later get the rewards. If not set, the identity account will be used.

Accounts need to be funded for gas fees. The delegation account is used of establishing voter power, which can be achieved by wrapping funds directly or by delegation from other accounts. Wrapping can be done via the [portal](https://governance.dev.aflabs.org/) (make sure to pick Coston, not Coston2).

Account registration is handled by the `EntityManager` smart contract, which for Coston can be accessed [here](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/address/0x35E74af3AfC322e1fCf187cB4970126D76fF9Dcd/write-contract#address-tabs).

The required contract invocation steps can be found in this [deployment task](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/deployment/tasks/register-entities.ts#L33). You can check out the smart contract repo and run the task itself, or register accounts manually via the explorer UI link above. (It only needs to be done once).

Instructions for the Hardhat deployment task:
- Check out repo: https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/
- Build repo: `yarn` then `yarn c`
- Create a JSON file with account keys:
```
[
  {
    "identity": {
      "address": "0xca84d6086c5b32212a0cf1638803355d7be31482",
      "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
    },
    "submit": {
      "address": "0x7961de7ad159106a79187379a22d21c1e5a924db",
      "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
    },
    "submitSignatures": {
      "address": "0x7570c09c17f79aa50bab7ba385c0d5ca12c5b4d3",
      "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
    },
    "signingPolicy": {
      "address": "0x9ffa9cf5f677e925b6ecacbf66caefd7e1b9883a",
      "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
    },
    "delegation": {
      "address": "0x95288e962ff1893ef6c32ad4143fffb12e1eb15f",
      "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
    },
  }
]
```
- Set the following env vars in `.env`:
```
COSTON_RPC=rpctocoston
CHAIN_CONFIG="coston"
ENTITIES_FILE_PATH="<path to account keys JSON>"
```
*Note 1: do not use .env.template, instead just create .env using above example or running tasks will error*

*Note 2: do not use public rpc because you will get rate limited during the task*

- Run task:
```
yarn hardhat --network coston register-entities
```

## Install dependencies

You will need:
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
    - `brew install jq`
    - `apt-get install jq`
    - `pacman -S jq`
- [envsubst](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-Invocation.html)
    - (macOS only) `brew install gettext`
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Set up repos and docker images

- Use `.env.example` to create `.env` file, eg.: using `cp .env.example .env`

- Set private keys for required accounts in the `.env` file.

- Set `NODE_RPC_URL` and `NODE_API_KEY` (optional) with your Coston node RPC endpoint in the `.env` file. 

- Use `./repos pull` to clone (first time) or pull (when cloned directories exist) projects. If you switch branches in .env file or you get errors while using `./repos pull` command, use `./repos clean` to delete files followed by `./repos pull` to clone them again. 

- Use `./build.sh` to build docker images for all projects.

## Start provider stack

Using `./run up` 4 services will start:
- `c-chain-indexer-db` - MySQL instance.
- `c-chain-indexer` â€“ **Indexer**.
- `flare-system-client` **System Client**.
- `ftso-scaling` - **Data Provider**.
*Note: you can stop everything with `./run down`*

There will also be config files generated for everything inside `./mounts` directory.

## Feed value provider

Start your own feed value provider or alternatively use example provider shipped with `ftso-scaling` project
```bash
docker run --rm \
  --env-file "mounts/scaling/.env" \
  --publish "0.0.0.0:3101:3101" \
  --network "ftso-v2-deployment_default" \
  "ftso-v2-deployment/ftso-scaling" \
  yarn start example_provider
```

Once the container is running, you can find the API spec at: http://localhost:3101/api-doc.

Note: some users reported issues with getting the provider to start. For initial testing a "fixed" value provider can be used that simply returns a constant instead of reading data from exchanges. It can be started by setting an extra env variable `VALUE_PROVIDER_IMPL=fixed`:
```bash
docker run --rm \
  --env-file "mounts/scaling/.env" \
  --env VALUE_PROVIDER_IMPL=fixed \
  --publish "0.0.0.0:3101:3101" \
  --network "ftso-v2-deployment_default" \
  "ftso-v2-deployment/ftso-scaling" \
  yarn start example_provider
```

You should see the following in the logs:
```
WARN [FixedFeed] Initializing FixedFeed, will return 0.01 for all feeds.
```

## How do I know it's working

You will see various errors initially on `ftso-scaling` and `flare-system-client`, since the data provider will not be registered as a voter for the current reward epoch. There is a time window for voter registration on every reward epoch, and if you leave things running you should eventually see `RegisterVoter success` logged by `flare-system-client`. It should then start submitting data successfully in the *following* reward epoch.

Here are log samples indicating successful operation (`flare-system-client`):
